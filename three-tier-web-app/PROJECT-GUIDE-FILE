# Architecture Overview
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): To host your infrastructure.
Public Subnet: For the web servers (EC2 instances) and Load Balancer.
Private Subnet: For the application servers (EC2 instances) and database (RDS instance).
Load Balancer: To distribute traffic across web servers.
Auto Scaling: To automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
Security Groups and Network ACLs: To control traffic between tiers.


# Step-by-Step Guide
1. Set Up VPC and Subnets
Create a VPC:

Open the VPC Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new VPC with a suitable CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Create Subnets:

Create two public subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs).
Create two private subnets in different AZs.
Create an Internet Gateway:

Attach the Internet Gateway to your VPC.
Update the route table for the public subnets to route traffic to the Internet Gateway.
Create NAT Gateway:

Create a NAT Gateway in one of the public subnets.
Update the route table for the private subnets to route traffic to the NAT Gateway.
2. Set Up Security Groups
Web Server Security Group:

Allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) from anywhere.
Allow outbound traffic to the application server and the Internet.
Application Server Security Group:

Allow inbound traffic on the required application port (e.g., 8080) from the web server security group.
Allow outbound traffic to the database server.
Database Security Group:

Allow inbound traffic on the database port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL) from the application server security group.
Restrict outbound traffic as needed.
3. Launch EC2 Instances
Web Servers:

Launch EC2 instances in the public subnets using the web server security group.
Install and configure the web server software (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
Application Servers:

Launch EC2 instances in the private subnets using the application server security group.
Install and configure the application server software.
Database Server:

Launch an RDS instance in the private subnets using the database security group.
Configure the database with the necessary schemas and data.
4. Configure Load Balancer
Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):

Place it in the public subnets.
Configure the ALB to route traffic to the web server instances.
Set Up Target Groups:

Create a target group for the web servers.
Register the web server instances with the target group.
Create Listeners:

Create listeners for HTTP and/or HTTPS.
Configure rules to forward traffic to the web server target group.
5. Set Up Auto Scaling
Create Launch Configuration/Template:

Define the AMI, instance type, and security group for the web and application servers.
Specify the startup script to install and configure necessary software.
Create Auto Scaling Groups:

Set up an auto-scaling group for the web servers using the public subnets.
Set up an auto-scaling group for the application servers using the private subnets.
Define the scaling policies based on CPU utilization or other metrics.
6. Configure Route 53 (Optional)
Register a Domain:

Register a domain in Route 53 or use an existing one.
Create DNS Records:

Create A/AAAA or CNAME records pointing to the ALB.
